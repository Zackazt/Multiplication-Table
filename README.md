# Multiplication-Table
Asks the user for a number and prints a multiplication table out up to the number entered in a very clean fashion.  
I hope to eventually be able to resolve the issue of space.  For instance:
If the user types a number too large to fit on one line of the console the table will begin to distort.  
I am sure there is a unique fix for this, but I have yet to think of it.
